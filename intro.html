                <p>The XOR gate, or Exclusive OR gate, is a pivotal logic gate in digital electronics, known for its unique operation. It shares the following key features and characteristics:</p>
                <p>Binary Inputs: Like other logic gates, the XOR gate has two binary inputs, generally labeled 'A' and 'B.' These inputs can be in one of two states: '0' (representing logic low) or '1' (representing logic high).</p>
                <p>Logical Operation: The XOR gate performs a logical XOR (Exclusive OR) operation on its inputs. Its output is '1' (logic high) if and only if one of its inputs, 'A' or 'B,' is '1,' but not both. If both inputs are '0' or '1,' the output is '0'.</p>
